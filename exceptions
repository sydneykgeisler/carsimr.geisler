In regards to the one note stating that .DS_Store was found. I tried many of the
suggestions on the website below to remove this file but to no avail.

For the 'unloads.R' package, I got two lintr suggestions. One said that line 3
should not be more than 80 characters, but this is because this line contains a
url. Another said that on line 4, the function name style should be snake_case.
However, it was typed this way because this was suggested code.
